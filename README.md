# Handwritten Digit Generator (0â€“9) using CVAE + Streamlit

This is a web application that generates handwritten digits (0â€“9) using a **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** trained on the **MNIST dataset**. The app is built with **Streamlit** and hosted on **Streamlit Cloud**.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Select any digit from **0 to 9**
- Generate **5 diverse images** of that digit (no repetitions)
- Images resemble the style and format of **MNIST digits**
- Powered by a **deep generative model trained from scratch** (no pre-trained weights)

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The model is a **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** implemented in **PyTorch**:

- **Input:** 28Ã—28 grayscale image + class label (0â€“9)
- **Latent vector:** 20 dimensions
- **Encoder:** Fully connected
- **Decoder:** Fully connected with conditional label embedding

The model was trained on **Google Colab** using the **T4 GPU** with the MNIST dataset.
